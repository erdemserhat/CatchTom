# Catch Tom

Catch Tom is a fun and challenging Android game where you need to tap on annoying Tom images that appear on the screen. The faster you tap, the higher your score, but be careful â€“ if you miss, Tom will mock you from another part of the screen.

## How to Play

1. **Tap on Tom:** Quickly tap on the Tom images as they appear on the screen.
2. **Earn Points:** The faster you tap, the more points you earn.
3. **Watch the Timer:** The game is against the clock. Be strategic with your taps to maximize your score.
